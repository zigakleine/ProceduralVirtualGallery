# ProceduralVirtualGallery
An application which generates a procedural 3d gallery space based on a sequence of images the user provides as input. It uses basic machine learning to group similar images and places them accordingly in 3d space. It then uses shape grammars to build a gallery around these images. It was implemented as the 2. seminal work for the course Interaction and information design.
